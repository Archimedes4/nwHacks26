# Somnia
Built for nwHacks26 see our devpost at [Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/somnia-o2y6v5#)

## Inspiration
Democratizing Wellness. We were inspired by industry leaders like the Calm app, yet concerned by the prohibitive costs of their premium subscriptions. We believe that mental health support and sleep hygiene should not be a luxury restricted by a paywall. Somnia was created to bridge this gap, providing high-quality wellness tools and data analysis at zero cost to the user, ensuring that financial status is never a barrier to a better night's rest.

## What it does
Somnia serves as a comprehensive wellness companion designed to mitigate stress and optimize sleep hygiene through data-driven insights. Key features include:

Privacy-First Access: Full support for anonymous authentication, allowing users to prioritize their health without compromising their personal identity.
Detailed Biological Profiling: Users can establish a baseline by inputting essential metrics including age, gender, height, and weight.
Predictive Pattern Analysis: The core of the app analyzes the complex interplay between biological profiles and lifestyle data, specifically focusing on:
Sleep and exercise duration.
Daily step counts and physical activity levels.
Resting heart rate and subjective stress levels.
## How we built it
We engineered Somnia using a modern, scalable architecture designed for high performance and universal accessibility:

Frontend: Developed with React Native, ensuring a fluid, native user experience across iOS, Android, and Web platforms from a single, unified codebase.
Backend: Leveraged Supabase to handle real-time database management and secure user authentication seamlessly.
Challenges we ran into
Overcoming Collaboration Friction. During the development process, we faced significant hurdles with version control and persistent merge conflicts. To resolve this, we pivoted our workflow to utilize Visual Studio Live Share. This allowed our team to engage in synchronous, real-time development on a shared environment, effectively eliminating code silos and transforming our bottleneck into a highly efficient collaborative process.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Refined UI/UX: We successfully designed a minimalist, intuitive interface that achieves aesthetic and functional parity with premium, paid competitors.
Custom Intelligence: We are particularly proud of developing and integrating our own trained model to analyze sleep patterns using specific datasets, providing users with sophisticated insights into their wellness.
What we learned
This project provided a deep dive into the practical application of machine learning, specifically in how to train and implement a model for biological data. Furthermore, we gained invaluable experience in agile collaboration, discovering how real-time sharing tools can drastically improve team velocity and code integrity.

## What's next for Somnia
Our roadmap for the future of Somnia focuses on expanding its wellness ecosystem through:

Multimodal Content: Integrating a library of relaxation soundscapes and guided wellness videos.
Hardware Ecosystem Integration: Expanding our data reach by syncing with smartwatches and fitness-tracking applications to automate health monitoring.
